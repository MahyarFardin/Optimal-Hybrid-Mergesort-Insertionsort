# Optimal value as treshold for a combined algorithm of merge and insertion sort

This repo contains a basic analysis of time complexity of algorithms and an analyse of gathered data; including time for each algorithm to run reflected to the size of given array. We found out that the optimal treshold for the algorithm is somewhere around 120, so for n's smaller than 120 insertion sort is optimal and for n's greater insertions sort is perefered.

**The optimal solution for this problem is 128 based on mathematical proofs**
